# Signal processing app

## Definition of done:
* Frontend mockups showing a **conceptual** version of what the UI would look like
* Backend endpoints that would be needed for such a mockup, **fully implemented**

## Things to note:
* All the relevant files for this project are in the **models** and **controllers** directores (as well as **spec/models** and **spec/controllers**. The rest is just boilerplate code!

## Running the container locally

Assuming you have docker installed, you can clone this repository, run `docker-compose build` and then run `rake db:setup` in the container.
